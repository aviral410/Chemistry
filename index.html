		<h1 class="title">Atoms</h1><br>
		<p class="body">An atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across. They are so small that accurately predicting their behavior using classical physics—as if they were tennis balls, for example—is not possible due to quantum effects.

Every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more protons and a number of neutrons. Only the most common variety of hydrogen has no neutrons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, then the atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively – such atoms are called ions.

The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the electromagnetic force. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the nuclear force. This force is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force. In this case, the nucleus splits and leaves behind different elements. This is a form of nuclear decay.

The number of protons in the nucleus is the atomic number and it defines to which chemical element the atom belongs. For example, any atom that contains 29 protons is copper. The number of neutrons defines the isotope of the element. Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules or crystals. The ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature. Chemistry is the discipline that studies these changes. <br><br>
Dalton's Atomic Theory is as follows : <br><br>
1) Atom is the smallest part of a matter. <br>
2) Atoms can neither be created nor be destroyed.	<br> 
3) An atom can exhibit all properties of that element.	<br>
4) Atoms combine in whole number ratios to form molecule.

		<h1 class="title">Sub-Atomic-Particles</h1><br>
		<p class="body">In the physical sciences, subatomic particles are smaller than atoms. They can be composite particles, such as the neutron and proton; or elementary particles, which according to the standard model are not made of other particles. Particle physics and nuclear physics study these particles and how they interact. The concept of a subatomic particle was refined when experiments showed that light could behave like a stream of particles (called photons) as well as exhibiting wave-like properties. This led to the concept of wave–particle duality to reflect that quantum-scale particles behave like both particles and waves (they are sometimes described as wavicles to reflect this[citation needed]). Another concept, the uncertainty principle, states that some of their properties taken together, such as their simultaneous position and momentum, cannot be measured exactly. The wave–particle duality has been shown to apply not only to photons but to more massive particles as well.

Interactions of particles in the framework of quantum field theory are understood as creation and annihilation of quanta of corresponding fundamental interactions. This blends particle physics with field theory.</p>

	<div class="electrons" id="elec">
		<h1 class="title">Electrons</h1><br>
		<p class="body">Electrons are the subatomic particles that orbit the nucleus of an atom. They are generally negative in charge and are much smaller than the nucleus of the atom. If you wanted a proper size comparison the size of the earth in comparison to the sun would be a pretty close visualization.

Electrons are known to fall into orbits or energy levels. These orbits are not visible paths like the orbit of a planet or celestial body. The reason is that atoms are notoriously small and the best microscopes can only view so much of atoms at that scale. Even if we could view electrons they would move too fast for the human eye. As a matter of fact scientists still can’t calculate the exact position of electrons. They can only estimate their locations. That is why the modern model of the atoms has an electron cloud surrounding the nucleus of an atom instead of a defined system of electrons in concentric orbits.</p>
<h1 class="title">Discovery of Electrons</h1><br>
<p class="body">In the late 19th century, physicist J.J. Thomson began experimenting with cathode ray tubes. Cathode ray tubes are sealed glass tubes from which most of the air has been evacuated. A high voltage is applied across two electrodes at one end of the tube, which causes a beam of particles to flow from the cathode (the negatively-charged electrode) to the anode (the positively-charged electrode). The tubes are called cathode ray tubes because the particle beam or "cathode ray" originates at the cathode. The ray can be detected by painting a material known as phosphors onto the far end of the tube beyond the anode. The phosphors spark, or emit light, when impacted by the cathode ray.</p><br><br>

The cathode ray is deflected away from the negatively-charged electric plate, and towards the positively-charged electric plate. The amount by which the ray was deflected by a magnetic field helped Thomson determine the mass-to-charge ratio of the particles.</p>

	<div class="protons" id="pro">
		<h1 class="title">Protons</h1><br>
		<p class="body">A proton is a subatomic particle with a mass defined as 1 and a charge of +1 (positive charge). A proton is indicated by either the symbol p or p+. The nucleus of every atom contains protons. The number of protons of an atom of an element is its atomic number.

Because both protons and neutrons are found in the atomic nucleus, they are collectively known as nucleons. While the positive electrical charge of protons causes them to repel each other, when protons and neutrons get close enough to each other, the strong nuclear force overcomes electrostatic repulsion. This allows them to bind together. Protons, like neutrons, are hadrons. A proton consists of still smaller subatomic particles called quarks. Each protons is composed of three quarks (2 up quarks and 1 down quark).</p>
		<h1 class="title">Discovery of Protons</h1><br>
		<p class="body">Protons are subatomic particles that, with neutrons and electrons, are the principal constituents of atoms.

Protons are positively charged particles that reside in the nucleus of an atom. These protons add the overall positive charge of a molecule. The mass of the proton is 1.6727g x 10 raised to -24, the electron 9.110g x 10 raised to -28.

Through scientific discovery, protons have been accepted as the particle that contributes to the positive charge of an atom. The discovery of protons can be attributed to Rutherford.

In 1886 Goldstein discovered existence of positively charged rays in the discharge tube by using perforated cathode. These rays were named as anode rays or cannal rays.

In 1899, Rutherford discovered alpha and beta ‘rays’ from uranium. He later demonstrated that alpha rays are the nuclei of helium atoms. He discovered in 1914 that the nucleus of an atom constituted and extremely dense but small fraction of the volume of an atom and that this nucleus was positive in charge.

Given the discoveries of electrons in 1897 by Thomson, Rutherford and other scientists decided that a positively charged particle must exist to center the electron to create equally neutral atoms.

Thomson proposed the name ‘positive rays’. Rutherford, in 1914, suggested that this something that was positively charged or the sportive ray of Thomson was a particle.

He gave the name ‘positive electron’ to it. The word ‘proton’ was assigned to this particle by 1920.

Rutherford continued to do research until his death, but the proton was his last big discovery.</p><br><br><br>

	<h1 class="title">Neutrons</h1> <br>
	<p class="body">Neutrons are subatomic particles that are one of the primary constituents of atomic nuclei. They are usually denoted by the symbol n or no. Neutrons do not have any net electric charge associated with them. They do, however, have mass which is slightly greater in magnitude than that of a proton. Neutrons and protons are collectively referred to as nucleons, since they behave in a similar manner inside the nuclei of atoms. The mass of a neutron can be roughly approximated to one atomic mass unit (often abbreviated to amu). The branch of science that deals with the study of the properties of neutrons and the interactions of these subatomic particles with other matter and electromagnetic radiation is called nuclear physics.

The overall nuclear and chemical properties of an element is usually determined by the total number of protons in its atomic nucleus (atomic number) and the total number of neutrons in its atomic nucleus (usually referred to as the neutron number). The sum of the total number of protons in an atomic nucleus and the total number of neutrons in the atomic nucleus yields the mass number of that atomic nucleus. It is important to note that different isotopes of the same element share the same atomic number but differ in their mass numbers (which implies that they all contain the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei but vary in the total number of neutrons that are present in their nuclei).

Inside the nucleus of the atom, the protons and the neutrons are bound together via nuclear forces. For the stability of atomic nuclei, the presence of neutrons is a must. The only exception to this rule is the protium (hydrogen-1) nucleus. One of the most important applications of neutrons is in nuclear reactors to facilitate nuclear fission reactions, and in some cases, nuclear fusion reactions.</p><br>
<h1 class="title">Discovery of Neutrons</h1> <br>
<p class="body">Discovery of Neutrons
Neutrons were first theorized by the New Zealand born British physicist Ernest Rutherford in the year 1920.
The discovery of neutrons is credited to the British physicist James Chadwick in the year 1932.
He was awarded the Nobel prize in physics for this discovery in the year 1935.
During the 1920s, the common assumption on the nature of atoms was that they consisted of protons and also nuclear electrons. However, this failed to comply with the Heisenberg uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics. In the year 1931, two German nuclear physicists observed that when the alpha particle radiation that is emitted by polonium is made incident on beryllium, lithium, or boron, it resulted in the production of an unusually penetrating form of radiation. Later, it was proven by James Chadwick through a series of experiments that these particles that constituted the unusually penetrating radiation were neutrons.
<br> <br>
Charge and Mass of Neutrons
The electric charge that is associated with a neutron is 0. Therefore, neutrons are neutrally charged subatomic particles.
The mass of a neutron is roughly equal to 1.008 atomic mass units. When converted into kilograms, the mass of the neutron can be approximated to 1.674*10-27 kg.
Since neutrons lack electric charge, their mass cannot be directly determined via the analytical technique of mass spectrometry.
The mass of the neutron can be calculated by subtracting the mass of a proton from the mass of a deuterium nucleus (deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen containing one proton, one electron, and one neutron in its atomic structure. Since the mass of the electron is negligible when compared to that of the proton and the neutron, the mass of the neutron can be calculated by subtracting the mass of the proton from the mass of the deuterium atom).

	<h1 class="title">Nucleus</h1>
	<p class="body">The atomic nucleus is the small, dense region consisting of protons and neutrons at the center of an atom, discovered in 1911 by Ernest Rutherford based on the 1909 Geiger–Marsden gold foil experiment. After the discovery of the neutron in 1932, models for a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons were quickly developed by Dmitri Ivanenko and Werner Heisenberg.An atom is composed of a positively-charged nucleus, with a cloud of negatively-charged electrons surrounding it, bound together by electrostatic force. Almost all of the mass of an atom is located in the nucleus, with a very small contribution from the electron cloud. Protons and neutrons are bound together to form a nucleus by the nuclear force.

The diameter of the nucleus is in the range of 1.7566 fm (1.7566×10−15 m) for hydrogen (the diameter of a single proton) to about 11.7142 fm for uranium.These dimensions are much smaller than the diameter of the atom itself (nucleus + electron cloud), by a factor of about 26,634 (uranium atomic radius is about 156 pm (156×10−12 m)) to about 60,250 (hydrogen atomic radius is about 52.92 pm).

The branch of physics concerned with the study and understanding of the atomic nucleus, including its composition and the forces which bind it together, is called nuclear physics.</p><br>
<h1 class="title">Discovery of Neutrons</h1>
<p class="body">This video takes us in 1911, in Manchester, on a journey through the history of particle physics., when Ernest Rutherford conducted a historical experiment that revealed that most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus made of protons and neutrons.


Alpha particles were the only nuclear projectiles available for physicists to use. Armed with radioactive sources, physicists were unwittingly examining the nuclei of atoms; so that by 1919 Rutherford was able to generate the first atomic transformation: a nuclear reaction. By firing alpha particles at nitrogen atoms, he was able to transform them into oxygen.

Over the following years, a large variety of nuclear reactions were observed and studied. The most important of these was the one which led to the 1932 observation of neutral radiation composed of particles with a mass approaching that of the proton. This was James Chadwick’s (1891-1973) discovery of the neutron. Soon after, Werner Heisenberg was the first to propose the theory that the nucleus was made up of protons and neutrons.

<h1 class="title">Experiment</h1>
<p class="body">Alpha backscattering on nucleus
Rutherford observed the backward bounce of some alpha particles as projectiles sent on the atoms of a thin gold foil. He interpreted this rebound as the "backscatter" of a light nucleus (alpha particle) on the heavy nucleus of a gold atom. Because of the mass ratio (A = 4 versus A = 197), the alpha particle bouncing off (on the left figure) at 150 °, loses only a small portion of its energy - that it gives to the gold nucleus - which allow it to emerge from the gold foil. On the contrary, in the case of a collision (on the right) with a lighter nucleus as oxygen (A = 16), the alpha loses most of its energy in aid of oxygen propelled forward.
IN2P3
Rutherford pointed out in a phrase made famous, that it was as “It was as if you fired a 15 inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you" (**) . He studied the phenomenon for a year and found the explanation: the atom positive charge is in a solid and compact nucleus. This nucleus concentrates almost the entire mass of the atom but occupies only a hundred millionth of a millionth of its volume. The atom is almost at one hundred percent empty.
